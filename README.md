## 🎮 Game Concept

In **Cherry Blossom: Sakura's Renewal**, you start your adventure sitting under a cherry blossom tree. The world slowly transforms into a **mystical and relaxing realm**, where a run-down café appears before you.

Your mission is to **restore the café** by:

* Brewing coffee, matcha, and tea
* Serving customers (both human and mystical)
* Repairing and upgrading the café to renew it and give it new life

The game blends **adventure RPG elements** with **cosy simulation gameplay**, creating a relaxing yet engaging experience.
